          <p>I Am My Bodyguard is a program that empowers children who have experienced sexual abuse or violence. It started as a workshop for children in collaboration with Innocence in Danger, an international non-profit organization in Gstaad.
            With the success of the initial I Am My Bodyguard workshop for children. Excel Security Solutions decided to develop a course specifically for some of the victims’ mothers, who were too often also victims of abuse. This program was named Fight Like a Girl!
            The program has a social mission: to provide free workshops to the most vulnerable women and children in developing countries, funded by donations and paid training for those who can afford it.
